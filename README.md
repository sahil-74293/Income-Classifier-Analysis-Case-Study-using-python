# Income-Classifier-Analysis-Case-Study-using-python
This GitHub repository hosts a binary classification case study I undertook during my journey in learning Python for data science. Within, you will find a comprehensive analysis, showcasing the practical insights I gained through the application of Python and key data science and machine learning concepts.
# Subsidy Income Classifier

This repository contains a case study focused on binary classification, specifically addressing the problem statement provided by Subsidy Inc. Subsidy Inc. delivers subsidies to individuals based on their income, and this case study aims to develop an income classifier system for individuals. The objective is to simplify the data system by reducing the number of variables to be studied without sacrificing accuracy. This system will assist the company in planning subsidy outlay, monitoring, and preventing misuse.

## Problem Statement

Subsidy Inc. has access to a large dataset of authenticated data on individual income, demographic parameters, and a few financial parameters. Accurate income data is challenging to obtain globally, making this dataset valuable. The task at hand is to create a robust income classifier system based on this data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Insights

During the analysis, several key insights were derived from the dataset:

1. Examined the variation of salaries across genders.
2. Visualized the frequency distribution of salary status.
3. Discovered that 75% of people have a salary status less than or equal to $50,000, while 25% have a salary status greater than $50,000.
4. Plotted a histogram of the age variable to identify the high-frequency age categories.
5. Found that people between the ages of 35-50 are more likely to earn more than $50,000 per year.
6. Discovered that people aged 25-35 are more likely to earn less than or equal to $50,000 per year.
7. Concluded that 56% of self-employed individuals earn more than $50,000 per year.
8. Observed that individuals with doctorate, master's, or proof-school education are more likely to earn above $50,000 per year compared to others.
9. Identified that those who earn more than $50,000 per year are likely to work in managerial and professional roles.
10. Noticed that individuals earning more than $50,000 per year tend to work around 40-50 hours per week based on the hours per week vs. salary status plot.

These insights provide a strong foundation for building the income classifier system, helping Subsidy Inc. make more informed decisions about subsidy allocation.
